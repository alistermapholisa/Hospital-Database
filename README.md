# Mnene Hospital Database Project üè•

<bold>Introduction<bold>
This project demonstrates the development and implementation of a relational database system for Mnene Hospital. The primary goal was to transition the hospital from an inefficient, risk-prone paper-based record-keeping system to a streamlined digital database solution using SQLite.

This project was completed as part of the ALX Academy curriculum.

üéØ Problem Statement
Mnene Hospital faced significant operational challenges due to its reliance on a paper-based file system, including:

Slow Record Access: Delays in retrieving patient data, slowing down treatment and diagnosis.

Administrative Inefficiency: High time consumption for administrative staff in managing physical files.

Data Risk: High probability of data loss, misplacement, or degradation of records.

‚ú® Solution
The solution was the design and implementation of a normalized SQLite database to centralize all hospital data‚Äîincluding Patients, Doctors, Appointments, and Admissions. This system is designed to:

Streamline Operations: Enable quick and accurate data retrieval.

Improve Coordination: Provide a single source of truth for all departments.

Enhance Data Integrity: Reduce errors associated with manual data entry and storage.
