# Mnene Hospital-Database
In this project, I created a hospital database using SQLite to help the local hospital transition from traditional paper-based record-keeping to a digital database system.

<p><b><u>Problem Statement</u></b></p>

Mnene Hospital relies on a paper-based file system, which causes delays in accessing records, administrative inefficiencies, and risks of data loss or misplacement. These challenges slow down treatments, reduce coordination across departments, and lower patient satisfaction. This project will implement a database system to streamline hospital operations, improve data accuracy and security, and enhance service delivery.
